/* This module should only contains functions which should be used to update the stats of the application.
 * Like number of users, or number of restaurants.
 * They are post respond functions,
 * they should be executed after sending response to client.
 * And their success or failure doesn't breaks any functionality.
 *
 * They should be at one place. So, can be used by every other module.
